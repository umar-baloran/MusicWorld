<span class="born">Born	</span><span class="born-name">: 6 Jan 1967</span><br />
<span class="year">Years active	</span><span class="year-name">: 1987–present</span><br />
<span class="description">About	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>A.R. Rehman is an Indian composer, singer-songwriter, music producer, musician and philanthropist. Described as the world's most prominent and prolific film composer by Time, Rahman's works are noted for integrating Eastern classical music with electronic music, world music and traditional orchestral arrangements. Among his awards are two Academy Awards, two Grammy Awards, a BAFTA Award, a Golden Globe, four National Film Awards, fifteen Filmfare Awards and thirteen Filmfare Awards South. Rahman's body of work for film and stage has given him the nickname of "the Mozart of Madras", and Tamil commentators and fans call him Isai Puyal (English: the Musical Storm). In 2009, Time included Rahman on its list of the world's most influential people. The UK-based world-music magazine Songlines named him one of "Tomorrow's World Music Icons" in August 2011.</p></span>

<br /><br /><br /><span class="description">Career	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>Rahman's film career began in 1992 when he started Panchathan Record Inn, a recording and mixing studio in his backyard. It would become the most-advanced recording studio in India. In 1987 Rahman, then still known as Dileep, composed jingles for a line of watches introduced by Allwyn. In 1992, he was approached by director Mani Ratnam to compose the score and soundtrack for his Tamil film, Roja. The film's cinematographer Santosh Sivan signed Rahman for the Malayalam film Yodha, directed by Sivan's brother Sangeeth Sivan and released in September 1992. The 1995 film Indira and romantic comedies Mr. Romeo and Love Birds also drew attention.
<br /><br />
In 2005 Rahman expanded his Panchathan Record Inn studio by establishing AM Studios in Kodambakkam, Chennai, creating the most cutting-edge studio in Asia. The following year he launched his own music label, KM Music, with his score for Sillunu Oru Kaadhal. In 2012 Rahman scored Ekk Deewana Tha and the American drama People Like Us, and collaborated with director Yash Chopra on Jab Tak Hai Jaan. all were positively received. By the end of the year his music for Mani Ratnam's Kadal was critically acclaimed, and the album topped the iTunes India chart for December. In 2013, Rahman had two releases: Raanjhanaa and Maryan. Both were successful, with the former nominated for a number of awards and the latter the iTunes India Tamil Album of 2013.</p></span>

<br /><br /><br /><span class="description">Personal Life	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>Rahman is married to Saira Banu and has three children: Khatija, Rahima and Ameen. Ameen has sung "NaNa" from Couples Retreat, and Khatija has sung "Pudhiya Manidha" from Enthiran. Rahman is the uncle of composer G. V. Prakash Kumar, the son of his older sister A. R. Reihana. Kumar's first film work was singing on Rahman's "Chikku Bukku Rayile", from his score for 1993's Gentleman. Reihana's film debut was singing on "Vidai Kodu Engal Naadae" from Kannathil Muthamittal, and she is a music director. Rahman's younger sister, Fathima, heads his music conservatory in Chennai. The youngest, Ishrath, has a music studio. Rahman is the brother-in-law of film actor Rahman.
<br /><br />
An atheist during much of his childhood, in 1989 Rahman converted to Islam (the religion of his mother's family). After the early death of his father, his family experienced difficult times; Sufism influenced his mother and, eventually, his family. During the 81st Academy Awards ceremony Rahman paid tribute to his mother: "There is a Hindi dialogue, mere pass ma hai, which means 'even if I have got nothing I have my mother here'." He said, "Ella pughazhum iraivanukke" ("All praise to God" in Tamil, a translation from the Quran) before his speech.</p></span>
