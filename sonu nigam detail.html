<h3 class="album-artist-detail">
<span class="born">Born	</span><span class="born-name">: 30 July 1973</span><br />
<span class="year">Years active	</span><span class="year-name">: 1985–present</span><br />
<span class="description">About	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>Sonu Nigam is an Indian singer whose songs have been featured mainly in Hindi and Kannada movies. He has also sung many songs in other languages including Oriya, Tamil, Assamese, Punjabi, Bengali, Malayalam, Marathi, Telugu and Nepali.</p></span>

<br /><br /><br /><span class="description">Career	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>His initial years in Mumbai proved to be a struggle, beginning by singing covers of Mohammed Rafi songs, mainly for a number of "Rafi Ki Yaadein" albums released by T-Series. T-Series promoter Gulshan Kumar gave him a chance to reach a larger audience. In these years Nigam's singing style was regarded by some to be a "Rafi clone". Nigam's first movie song as a playback singer was for Janam (1990), which was never officially released. He then began making radio commercials.
<br /><br />
Nigam started hosting the popular TV show, Sa Re Ga Ma, in 1995 with the first episode airing on 1 May. The singing talent competition soon became one of the most popular shows on Indian television. Soon after, he sang "Accha Sila Diya" for the film Bewafa Sanam (1995). His first major success was with the Anu Malik-composed song "Sandese Aate Hai" in Border (1997). Sonu's image as a 'Rafi clone' changed after his rendition of the Nadeem-Shravan-composed song "Yeh Dil Deewana" in Pardes in the same year. Sonu's Album "Deewana", with music directed by Sajid-Wajid, was released by T-Series in 1999, revealing his talent for singing romantic songs and it remains one of India's most successful albums. Since then, he has created a unique style of his own and has become a role model for emerging vocal talent in India.
<br /><br />
Over the years, Nigam became a major force in the Indian music industry. He provided playback singing for Hindi movies and won many awards, notably the title song of the film Kal Ho Naa Ho. He recorded romantic, rock, sad and patriotic songs. Nigam sang in many languages besides Hindi, including Kannada, Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, English,Maithili , Bhojpuri, Urdu, Nepali, Chhattisgarhi, Malayalam and Marathi.</p></span>

<br /><br /><br /><span class="description">Personal Life	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>Nigam was born at Faridabad in a Kayastha family. He began his singing career at the age of four, when he joined his father Agam Kumar Nigam on stage to sing Mohammed Rafi's song "Kya Hua Tera Vaada, Wo Kasam Wo Irada". From then on, Sonu accompanied his father on his singing appearances at weddings and parties. In his teenage years, he successfully participated in music. He moved to Mumbai with his father to begin his Bollywood singing career at the age of 19. He was trained by Hindustani classical singer Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan.
<br /><br />
Nigam married Madhurima, who is from a Bengali family, on 15 February 2002. They have a son, Nevaan, born in 2007. He practices fitness and yoga exercises, and has trained in Taekwondo. He claims to be spiritual rather than religious.
<br /><br />
He has done work for various charities in India as well as abroad for the Dignity Foundation, for various organizations working in the fields of cancer, leprosy, blindness and women's welfare, and for families affected by the Kargil war and earthquakes. He also sponsors a child from the organization "Crayon".</p></span>
