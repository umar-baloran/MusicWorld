Amitabh Bhattacharya
</h3>


<h3 class="album-artist-detail">
<span class="born">Born	</span><span class="born-name">: 15 Aug 1973</span><br />
<span class="year">Years active	</span><span class="year-name">: 2009–present</span><br />
<span class="description">About	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>Amitabh Bhattacharya is an Indian lyricist and playback singer.  He shot to fame with the film Dev.D. The song "Emosanal Attyachar" from the movie was an instant hit.   He has been continuously writing lyrics for a variety of Bollywood movies since then and has also sung a few of them. Bhattacharya has also maintained a close association with Amit Trivedi since their first film Aamir. He has written the lyrics or sang for most of the film albums composed by the latter. His lyrics have been variously described as "frillfree" and "smartly worded. </p></span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class="description">Career	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>Amitabh Bhattacharya came to Bollywood eight years back. His dream was to become a playback singer but destiny had something else in store for him. He was offered to be the lyricist in the movie Aamir. He was not quite certain about it but still gave his best and the result was that his songs were appreciated a lot.

After the success of this movie, Amitabh Bhattacharya signed Dev D. In this movie the lyrics that he gave were quite different and created a style which no one had thought about earlier. The song 'emotional Athyachar' is one of its kinds. The funny, weird wordings of this song became an instant hit. Even he was surprised by the result of such wired wordings that this song had. In spite of the success of his lyricist career, Amitabh Bhattacharya's dream to become a play back singer was still in his heart.
<br /><br />
He got the golden opportunity to show his singing talent in the movie wake Up Sid. He was offered to write down the lyrics of the movie but it was Javed Akhtar who eventually wrote the song and Amitabh was asked to sing, his voice was liked by all.
<br /><br />
A successful playback singer and a lyricist, Amitabh Bhattacharya has a long way to go and make his unique mark in Bollywood. </p></span>
<br /><br /><br /><span class="description">Personal Life	</span><span class="description-name">: <p>I come from a middle-class Bengali family from Lucknow. My nani was from Mumbai and so I was born in Malad, coincidentally 15 minutes away from my current place. My father is a retired civil servant and my mother, a housewife. I started singing for orchestras during college and came to Mumbai 12 years ago to become a singer. I pitched to many music directors, but got to sing only jingles and scratches for film songs. Lyrics happened on the way. I started writing by default, but started getting appreciation for it.
<br /><br />
I met Amit Trivedi through a common friend Amartya, who had his own band and had made a fusion album for Times Music. He needed someone to write for his album and that's the time I first wrote, though under a pen name. Amit knew this and so in 2007, when he was composing the music for Aamir, he asked me to write for him even though I was quite hesitant initially. I wrote for Aamir after which Dev.D happened and things changed for both of us.</p></span>
